# leap-step

A Clojure project that uses ohpauleez library "clojure-leap" in conjunction with the Music library "overtone" and the shader library "shadertone" to create interactive motion based dubstep and music visualization.

How to use:
* Vertical position impacts "wobbles" (basically number of 'wubs' per beat)
* Horizontal position impacts pitch/frequency
* One open hand (with detectable fingers) produces low heavy dubstep bass
* A closed fist detects higher pitch chords
* two hands produces mid-range fifths
