# Notice
This is very much a work in progress, as I interact and develop more with the Leap Motion

Docs will be written once the code stablized.
There is currently no release in Clojars.

# clojure_leap

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Usage

FIXME
See an [example video](http://www.pauldee.org/ClojureLeapMouse.mov) of the mouse demo.

## TODO

Not necessarily in this order 

 * Full docs on everything - API, Marg, Tutorial, walk-through the examples
 * API Docs are clear about what is core Leap API and what is added/extra in the Clojure interface
 * Wiki docs on performance and ideal usage patterns
 * A way to average/smooth the mouse movement so it isn't so bouncey/glitchy
 * Write a gesture composition function or macro
 * Finish up Vector functions
 * create a `movements` ns, in it, create a palm-controlled `joystick`
